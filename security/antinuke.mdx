## Why use an antinuke system?

It's important to have an antinuke system in place to prevent moderators from abusing their permissions. This is a security measure which lets your server stay safe from any harmful actions.

## How does the antinuke work?

The antinuke will set a limit on the number of actions a moderator can perform in a certain time frame. If the limit is exceeded, the moderator will be punished and a message will be sent to the owner.

## Configuring the antinuke

<Warning>
  Discord recently implemented a new **mass ban** feature which can quickly ban
  **100\+ members**. It's **HIGHLY** recommended to utilize [fake
  permissions](/security/fake-permissions) to prevent moderators from using this
  feature.
</Warning>

### Allowing users to configure the antinuke

Initially, only the **server owner** can configure the antinuke. However, you can allow other users to configure the antinuke with the `antinuke admin` command.

<Warning>
  This is a dangerous command and will allow the user to entirely alter the
  antinuke configuration.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,antinuke admin (user)
```


```javascript Example
,antinuke admin @jonathan
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

### Exempting users from the antinuke

You can exempt users from the antinuke with the `antinuke whitelist` command.

<Warning>
  This is a dangerous command and will allow the user to bypass the antinuke
  entirely.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,antinuke whitelist (user)
```


```javascript Example
,antinuke whitelist @jonathan
```

</CodeGroup>
