## Overview

Moderation commands require some basic setup before they can be used. This includes **moderation logs**, **mute roles**, and the **jailed role & channel**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating the case logs & jail role">
    <Info>
      Jail is a feature similar to mute, but it restricts users from all channels except `#jail`.
    </Info>

    Use the `,setup` command to create the case logs channel and jail role.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Creating the necessary mute roles">
    <Info>
      This will create a **text mute**, **image mute**, and **reaction mute** role.
    </Info>

    Use the `,setupmute` command to create the necessary mute roles.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Upon completion of the setup, you'll notice a few new roles and channels in your server.

* **Muted** - Used to restrict users from sending messages.

* **Image Muted** - Used to restrict users from uploading attachments.

* **Reaction Muted** - Used to restrict users from reacting to messages.

* **Jailed** - Used to restrict users from all channels except the `#jail` channel.

  * The jailed role cannot be renamed since it's found by its name.

<Info>
  The `#jail-log` channel logs all moderation actions done through lowest (e.g.
  `,ban` & `,kick`). The `#jail` channel is where users jailed by the `jail`
  command are restricted to.
</Info>

## Setting Staff Roles

It's important to set the staff roles in your server to ensure that lowest can identify who has dangerous permissions. This is necessary for the `stripstaff` punishment to work.

Use the `,bind staff @role` command to set a role as a staff role, you would re-run the command if you don't want a role set as staff anymore.


## Invoke Messages

You can customize the response for moderation commands which is by default `üëç` and the direct message which will be sent after punishing the user.

The following moderation commands can be customized:

* `jail`, `kick`, `ban`, `tempban`, `softban`, `hardban`, `timeout` & `warn`.

<Tip>
  The `message` parameter can be raw text or an [embed](/resources/scripting/embeds) with dynamic [variables](/resources/scripting/variables).
</Tip>
