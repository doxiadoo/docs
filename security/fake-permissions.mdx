### Why use fake permissions?

Fake permissions negate the possibility of a rogue moderator using a script which floods the **Discord API** and mass bans all members, or any other harmful action.
It's a security measure which ensures that your server can't be nuked whatsoever.

### How do fake permissions work?

When a moderator is given fake permissions, such as `ban_members`, they will be able to use the `ban` command with lowest, but they won't be able to use the native **Discord** ban feature.

### Getting command permissions

You can locate the required permissions for a command with `,help (command)`.
