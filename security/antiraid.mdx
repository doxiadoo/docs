## Configuring the antiraid system

### Preventing mass joins

This module will trigger when the number of accounts joining the server exceeds the threshold within a short time frame.

<Warning>
  Whenever the threshold is reached, the server will be placed in a raid state.
  This will temporarily disable intensive events which lowest dispatches, such as
  **welcome** and **goodbye** messages.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Syntax
  ,antiraid massjoin (on or off) [--threshold (number)] [--do (action)] [--lock (true | false)] [--punish (true | false)]
  ```

  ```javascript Example
  ,antiraid massjoin on --threshold 5 --do ban --lock true --punish true
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing the antiraid configuration

You can use the `antiraid config` command to view the current antiraid configuration.


## What to do after a raid

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cleaning up">
    After a raid, it's recommended to clean up the server by removing all the accounts that joined during the raid, you can do this with the `recentban` and `raid` commands.

    <Info>
      The `duration` parameter must use the proper format, you can learn more
      [here](/resources/syntax#formatting-a-duration).
    </Info>

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript Syntax
      ,recentban (amount) <reason>
      ,raid (duration) (kick or ban) <reason>
      ```

      ```javascript Example
      ,recentban 50 // Bans the last 50 accounts that joined the server
      ,raid 2h ban // Bans all accounts that joined the server in the last 2 hours
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disabling the raid state">
    After the raid is over, you can disable the raid state with the `antiraid state` command, this will re-enable events, unlock channels, and allow accounts to join the server.
  </Step>
